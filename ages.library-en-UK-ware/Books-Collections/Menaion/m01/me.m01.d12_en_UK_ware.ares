For, becoming man on account of our transgression, He who alone is clean and undefiled was cleansed in the Jordan that we might be made clean, sanctifying us and the waters, and crushing the heads of the dragons in the water. Let us then draw water in gladness, O brethren: for upon those who draw with faith, the grace of the Spirit is invisibly bestowed by Christ the God and Saviour of our souls."
