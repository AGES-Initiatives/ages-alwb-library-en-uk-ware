meMA.Ode3KathismaSt.text = "By Thine own free choice, O compassionate Christ, Thou hast endured a shameful death upon the Cross; and when Thy Mother saw Thee she was wounded in her heart and, beating her breast, with a mother's sorrow she lamented. At her prayers, through Thy tender mercy have pity on the world and save it, for Thou dost take away its sin."
